# Recipe 01 — Your first audit

**Goal:** point Mollify at a project and understand what comes back. One command,
no config.

```bash
cd cookbook/sample-project
mollify audit
```

*(Trimmed here for the page — the real run prints all 16 findings; the lines
above are the first 11, verbatim.)*

That's the whole product in one screen. `audit` runs **every** engine — dead
code, deps, complexity, duplication, architecture, types, security — in a single
deterministic pass and folds the result into one report.

## How to read it

```
billing/app.py:12   [warn/certain]   unused-export   — function `_legacy_helper` …   (unused-export:b3454f8f0092acf5)
└── where ───────┘   └─ sev/conf ─┘   └── rule ────┘   └────────── reason ────────┘   └───── fingerprint ─────┘
```

- **Quality score (0–100)** — one number for "how healthy is this code?" Great for
  trend lines and badges. The sample sits at **84** (penalties are weighted by
  confidence, so low-confidence review items count less than proven defects).
- **severity** (`error` / `warn`) decides the **exit code**. Warnings exit `0`;
  errors exit `1`. Everything here is `warn`, so `audit` exits `0` — it's
  advisory until *you* decide a rule should fail the build (Recipe 05).
- **confidence** (`certain` / `likely` / `uncertain`) is Mollify's honesty knob.
  Python dead-code detection is undecidable in general, so a `certain` finding is
  provable and a `likely` one has a small residual dynamic risk. Only `certain`
  findings are ever auto-fixed (Recipe 03).
- **fingerprint** (`unused-export:b3454f8f0092acf5`) is a stable, content-derived id. It
  survives line moves and reformatting — which is what makes baselines and
  PR-scoped gates possible (Recipe 05).

## Focus on one area

`audit` is the firehose. Each engine is also its own subcommand when you want to
zoom in:

```bash
mollify dead-code     # just unused files / exports / imports / variables
mollify deps          # just dependency hygiene
mollify complexity    # just complexity hotspots
mollify security      # just security candidates
mollify arch          # just architecture / import cycles
```

## Point it anywhere

```bash
mollify audit --path /path/to/your/project
```

No config file required. When you *want* to tune thresholds, severities, or
ignore paths, add a `.mollifyrc.json` (`mollify init` scaffolds one) — see
[configuration.md](../../docs/configuration.md).

## Control what gets scanned

Discovery always prunes a builtin denylist (`.venv`, `.git`, `__pycache__`,
`node_modules`, `build`, `dist`, …) plus anything your `.mollifyrc.json` adds via
`exclude_dirs` — so vendored or virtualenv code never shows up as a false
positive. The sample project actually has a `node_modules/` directory checked in
(an accidentally-vendored helper), and it's invisible by default:

```bash
mollify audit
```

```text
Mollify audit — .
Quality score: 84/100
16 finding(s) across 7 file(s) — 0 error, 16 warn
```

Need to scan one anyway — auditing a vendored fork before deleting it, or a
`node_modules` package you suspect is stale? `--include <DIR>` (repeatable)
overrides the builtin denylist, `exclude_dirs`, *and* `.gitignore` for that
directory name (this sample project's own `.gitignore` lists `node_modules/`),
one invocation at a time:

```bash
mollify audit --include node_modules
```

```text
Mollify audit — .
Quality score: 84/100
18 finding(s) across 8 file(s) — 0 error, 18 warn
  …
  node_modules/leftpad/__init__.py:4 [warn/likely] untyped-function — public function `pad` has no type annotations (0/2 params typed, no return type)  (untyped-function:7732bf595fb1c176)
  node_modules/leftpad/__init__.py:4 [warn/likely] unused-export — function `pad` has no reachable references in the project  (unused-export:54aef9d4df4d4f22)
  …
```

`--include` is a per-invocation override, not a config setting — it doesn't
touch `.mollifyrc.json`, so your team's defaults stay intact for everyone else.
It does not override the `pyvenv.cfg` virtualenv guard, so an `--include`'d
directory that's itself a virtualenv stays excluded.
