# Mollify — Build Status / Log

This is the running build log. **Update it every working session** so context loss
never erases progress. It records: per-phase status, what compiles/tests, and
every deviation from `PLAN.md` (with rationale).

Legend: ✅ done & tested · 🟡 in progress · ⬜ not started · 🔵 scaffolded (compiles, stubbed)

## Environment constraints discovered (these shape the build)
- cargo 1.94.1, rustc 1.94.1, `cc`/`gcc` present. crates.io fetch works.
- **Git dependencies from GitHub are BLOCKED** (cargo → HTTP 403 via egress proxy).
  → The plan's `ruff_python_parser` (git-rev) path is not buildable here.
  See **ADR-0001**: we build on `tree-sitter-python` (crates.io) behind a parser
  abstraction; ruff crates remain the future migration.

## Deviations from PLAN.md (documented as required)
| # | Plan said | What we did | Why | Where |
|---|-----------|-------------|-----|-------|
| D1 | Parser = ruff_python_parser via pinned git rev (§3.2) | tree-sitter-python via crates.io, behind `mollify-parse` abstraction | GitHub git deps blocked by egress (403) | ADR-0001 |
| D2 | Crate names `config/types/parse/...` (§3.1) | `mollify-*` prefix (e.g. `mollify-types`) | avoid crates.io name clashes; clearer | this file |

## Phase status
- **Phase 0 — Skeleton + parser POC:** ✅
  - ✅ workspace, toolchain, gitignore
  - ✅ `mollify-types` (4 tests), `mollify-parse` (6 tests), `mollify-graph` (4 tests)
- **Phase 1 — MVP dead-code + deps:** ✅ (core complete, tested, dogfooded)
  - ✅ `mollify-graph` — discovery (ignore walker), path-sorted FileIds, dotted-name
    resolution (incl. src-layout + relative imports), import edges, BFS reachability
    from entry points, symbol-usage queries (internal count + cross-module + `from x import`).
  - ✅ `mollify-core` — dead-code engine (unused-file, unused-export) with confidence
    tiers (certain/likely/uncertain) + `__all__`/dunder suppression + dynamic-sink
    downgrade; deps engine (unused/missing dependency) parsing pyproject (PEP 621 +
    Poetry + PEP 735) with stdlib set + import→dist alias table; deterministic
    fingerprints (`<rule>:<xxh3>`); quality score; kind-discriminated reports. 9 tests.
  - ✅ `mollify-cli` — `mollify` binary: `audit`/`dead-code`(alias `check`)/`deps`/`init`,
    `--format human|json`, `--path`, CI exit code on errors. Dogfooded on a sample
    project (correct results: private→certain+autofix, public→likely, orphan file,
    missing numpy, unused rich/leftover-pkg; requests+stdlib+cross-module not flagged).
  - **Total: 23 tests green; `cargo build`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy` clean.**
  - ✅ Phase-1 polish landed: **SARIF 2.1.0** output (`--format sarif`, `mollify-core/sarif.rs`);
    **`--gate new-only`** + `--base <ref>` (git change detection in `mollify-core/git.rs`,
    file-level introduced/inherited attribution — line-level base-worktree is the documented
    upgrade); framework entry-point plugins (done in Phase 2). Agent hooks now use `--gate new-only`.
  - ✅ **`.mollifyrc.json`** now read (`mollify-core/config.rs`): per-rule/category severity
    overrides (so teams can make rules `error` → CI/hooks block), `ignore` path substrings,
    complexity thresholds. Applied across every engine.
  - ✅ **`mollify fix`** (`mollify-core/fix.rs`): removes only `certain` + `auto_fixable`
    unused symbols, bottom-up; dry-run by default, `--apply` to write. Verified.
  - ⏳ Still open (nice-to-have): line-level gate (base-worktree), named arch presets,
    churn×complexity ranking, LSP, runtime/type intelligence (Phase 4).
- **Phase 2 — dupes + complexity + arch:** ✅ (all three engines done, tested, in `audit`)
  - ✅ **Framework plugins** (`mollify-core/plugins.rs`) — decorator registry (routes, tasks,
    fixtures, signal receivers, CLI commands, validators…) marks registered symbols reached;
    parser now captures decorators per def. The dominant false-positive killer.
  - ✅ **Architecture** (`arch.rs`) — circular-dependency detection via Tarjan SCC over the
    import graph (`graph.find_cycles()`), `circular-dependency` findings (Certain). Named
    boundary presets still pending.
  - ✅ **Complexity** (`complexity.rs`) — cyclomatic + cognitive per function (computed in the
    parser over the tree), `high-complexity` findings above thresholds. Churn×complexity
    hotspot ranking still pending (needs git log --numstat).
  - ✅ **Duplication** (`dupes.rs`) — Rabin-Karp token-clone detector (Python tokenizer,
    literal-blinded), maximal-window extension + clone families. SA-IS+LCP is the documented
    upgrade. (jscpd-class detector.)
  - ✅ CLI: `arch`, `complexity` (alias `health`), `dupes`; all five engines fold into `audit`.
  - **39 tests green.**
- **Phase 3 — AI/MCP + plugins:** 🟡 (MCP server done; plugins pending)
  - ✅ `mollify-mcp` — a minimal, dependency-light **MCP stdio server** (newline-delimited
    JSON-RPC 2.0): `initialize`/`ping`/`tools/list`/`tools/call`, tools `mollify_audit`/
    `mollify_dead_code`/`mollify_deps`, kind-discriminated text results, stderr-only logging.
    5 unit tests + verified end-to-end over real stdio (initialize → tools/list → tools/call
    audit returns kind=audit score=77). Wired as `mollify mcp`.
  - **This makes every platform's MCP registration functional** (one server, many front-ends).
  - ⬜ framework entry-point plugins, LSP, agent-skills repo packaging.
- **Phase 4 — runtime/type intelligence:** 🟡 (type-health shipped; runtime/notebooks/security pending)
  - ✅ **Type-health** (`typehealth.rs`, `mollify types`) — annotation-coverage engine: parser
    captures per-function param/return annotation counts (excluding self/cls); flags
    fully-untyped public functions (`untyped-function`, category `type-health`). A
    Python-specific differentiator with no fallow analog. Folded into `audit`. 1 test.
  - ✅ **Security** (`security.rs`, `mollify security`) — bandit-style candidate producer:
    dangerous-eval, subprocess-shell-true, unsafe-yaml-load, unsafe-deserialization,
    tls-verify-disabled, hardcoded-secret. Category `security`. Folded into `audit`. +tests.
  - ✅ **Churn×complexity hotspots** (`hotspots.rs`) — `git log` churn × per-file
    cyclomatic complexity → ranked refactor-priority `hotspot` findings (the clean FOSS
    Python white space). In `complexity` + `audit`. +test.
  - ✅ **Notebooks (.ipynb)** — discovery + code-cell extraction (`graph::read_source`);
    notebooks are analyzed by every engine (treated as entry scripts). +test.
  - ✅ **Runtime-coverage merge** (`coverage.rs`, `mollify coverage --coverage-file`) —
    reads a coverage.py JSON report; flags reachable-but-never-executed functions as
    `cold-code` (the cold-path signal; fallow's *paid* feature, here free). +test.
  - ✅ **Named architecture presets / layer boundaries** (`arch.rs::analyze_layers`,
    `.mollifyrc` `architecture.layers`/`preset`) — emits `layer-violation` when a module
    imports a higher layer; presets `layered`/`hexagonal`/`feature-sliced`/`bulletproof`
    expand to default orderings. In `arch` + `audit`. +tests.
  - ✅ **Declarative rule packs / policies** (`policy.rs`, `.mollifyrc` `policies`) —
    `forbid_import`/`forbid_call`, optionally path-scoped; deterministic `certain`
    violations under custom rule ids. In `arch` + `audit`. +tests.
  - ✅ **`mollify explain [<rule>]`** (`explain.rs`) — rule semantics/confidence/action,
    no analysis run; lists all rules with no argument. +test.
  - ✅ **`mollify trace <module>`** (`trace.rs`) — a module's import neighborhood
    (imports + imported-by) from the static graph; `--format json`. +test.
  - ✅ **`mollify watch`** — poll-based re-run of `audit` on any `.py` add/edit/remove
    (dependency-free file-signature diff; `--interval-ms`).
  - ✅ **Supply-chain / CVE join** (`supplychain.rs` + `version.rs`,
    `mollify supply-chain`) — matches pinned/locked versions (requirements `==`,
    poetry/uv lockfiles) against a local advisory DB (`mollify-advisories/1`),
    emitting `vulnerable-dependency`. Determinism preserved: the DB is an input
    file; `scripts/fetch-advisories.py` refreshes it from OSV.dev / safety-db
    out-of-band (the OSV *query* API is egress-blocked, but the OSV GCS export is
    reachable). PEP 440-subset version matcher. Folded into `audit` when
    `.mollify/advisories.json` is present. Validated against real OSV data
    (25k+ advisories). +tests.
  - ✅ **MCP server exposes every engine** (`mollify-mcp`): audit/dead-code/deps/arch/
    complexity/dupes/types/security/coverage/supply-chain + explain + trace. +tests.
  - ✅ **Unused-import detection + autofix** (`deadcode.rs::unused_imports`) — parser
    now tracks import *bindings* (alias-aware) and *local uses* (identifiers outside
    import statements); flags whole-statement-unused imports (`unused-import`), certain
    + auto-fixable in regular modules, uncertain in `__init__.py` (re-export idiom).
    `mollify fix` removes them. +tests.
  - ⬜ LSP server; line-level (vs file-level) gate attribution; LibCST
    format-preserving autofix (current `fix` is line-range deletion); partial-line
    unused-import removal (only whole-statement today).
- **Agent integrations** (`.devin/` skills+rules+hooks, `.windsurf/` workflows): ✅ shipped, honoring the real CLI
  - `.devin/skills/mollify/SKILL.md` (+ `references/cli-reference.md`, `references/json-contract.md`)
  - `.devin/rules/mollify.md` (glob `**/*.py`)
  - `.devin/hooks.v1.json` (Devin/Claude-compatible: PostToolUse + Stop) and
    `.windsurf/hooks.json` (Cascade: post_write_code) → `scripts/mollify-report.sh` (verified)
  - `.windsurf/workflows/mollify-audit.md`, `mollify-cleanup.md`
  - **Note:** hooks are *advisory* (run audit + surface findings), not blocking,
    because the `--gate new-only` blocking gate is not built yet. Upgrade them to
    blocking once the gate + `attribution` land. README.md added.
  - User confirmed `.devin` = hooks/skills/rules, `.windsurf` = workflows.
  - **All four other platforms shipped** (generated + verified via a dynamic Workflow —
    parallel generate → adversarial verify gate → fix loop; all passed first-pass):
    - **Claude Code:** `.mcp.json`, `.claude/skills/mollify/SKILL.md` (+ references), `.claude/commands/mollify-{audit,cleanup}.md`, `.claude/settings.json` (PostToolUse+Stop hooks → mollify-report.sh).
    - **Codex:** `AGENTS.md` (delimited block), `.codex/config.toml` (`[mcp_servers.mollify]`), `.agents/skills/mollify/SKILL.md` (+ references) — the portable open-standard skill.
    - **Cursor:** `.cursor/rules/mollify.mdc` (glob comma-string), `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.cursor/commands/mollify-audit.md`.
    - **Gemini CLI:** `GEMINI.md`, `.gemini/settings.json`, `.gemini/commands/mollify/audit.toml`.
    - All JSON/TOML validated; all reference only real commands; MCP all → `mollify mcp`.
